\frametitle{Everything which is not forbidden is allowed}

 Generally, in the legal system everything that is not explicitly forbidden is legal.

 \begin{handlist}
 \item For example, in Kearney, backyard chickens are prohibited by
 city code,  so chickens in town are illegal,


 \item but painting your house purple is legal because purple houses aren't mentioned in city code.

 \end{handlist}


 Of course, I'm not a lawyer, so \dots
